//User Manual (Report)

//Special Libraries
  In order to compile our program, the only special libraries needed are:
    - SDL2 
    - SLD2_Image 
    - SDL_mixer
  All other libraries should be standard on the machines and should not cause any issues when compiling. 

//Compiling
  To compile our program, you simply have to type "make" and the program will be compiled and should be able to run. Provided the libraries above are available. Nothing out of the ordinary here. 
  
//User's Manual
  //Controls
  The game is very simple to play, but is intended to be played by two players. The controls are as follows:
    Player One:
      - 'A' : Move left
      - 'D' : Move right
      - 'W' : Jump
      - 'A'+'S' : Throw left
      - 'D'+'S' : Throw right
      
    Player Two:
      - 'J' : Move left
      - 'L' : Move right
      - 'I' : Jump
      - 'J'+'K' : Throw left
      - 'L'+'K' : Throw right

		Quitting:
			- 'ESC' : Quit the game
			
  //Gameplay
  The goal of the game is to simply score on the other player's goal, but it isn't as simple as it sounds. Once a player runs over the ball, he/she will pick the ball up and then be able to run around the arena in an attempt to get closer to the goal for a better shot. However, if the other player runs into the player holding the ball, the ball will be knocked loose and can be grabbed by any whichever character reaches the ball again first. 
  If the offensive player finds a suitable place and decides to take a shot, he/she shoots in the desired direction and hopes that the ball can make it to the goal. The defensive player can even get in front of the shot and block the shot if he/she can get there in time, but if not, it's a goal for the offensive player!
  //Scoring
  The scoring system works in a way that rewards fancier shots. Each time the ball bounces on its way to the goal, the more points the goal is worth. If the ball bounces once before making it into the goal, the goal is worth two points instead of one. If it bounces two times, the goal is worth 3 and so on. It adds a twist that means the defender must always be alert and conscious of stopping the long-range and spectacular shots. 
  
//Bugs
  //Collision System
  The collision system is the main source of errors in the program. Oftentimes, the player and the ball will clip through various places in the arena. Usually it's only through corners of thin platforms, but more rarely they will go through the boundaries of the arena, disappearing beyond the visible game window. This may result in a segmentation fault if it happens in a certain way, but hopefully that will not be the case when you're in the middle of a heated game. 
  //Blocking Shots
  When a player attempts to block a shot and the ball is moving at a high velocity, the ball may simply go through the player and a block may not occur. This is not game-breaking, but it could provide some unexpected moments during gameplay. The shot blocking mechanic happens as a factor of time the ball has been in the air, so if a player tries to pick up a recently thrown ball, it may just bounce of the player as well.
 
//Wishlist
  //Scoreboard
  We were not able to get a scoreboard implemented on screen, however the score is kept track of and displayed in the terminal. 
  //Organiztion
  The github repository is a mash-up of different files. We did our best to clean it up, but mainly jus stay in the master folder, otherwise, who knows where you'll end up.
